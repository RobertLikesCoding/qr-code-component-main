## My process

 I started by creating [this text file](./where_to_start.txt) to write a guide for myself on how to approach the project.
 Then I went ahead and did all those steps one by one.

### Built with

- HTML5, CSS
- Flexbox (for centering the card)

### What I learned

I learned once more how to center a div on a blank page. Also this was a good reminder on how to integrate an image into a card. Usually I would create a "image-container" div for the image but since the challenge was basic I decided to keep it simple.
